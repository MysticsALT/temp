# Mystics Hub

The current Lumber Tycoon 2 module is **Mystics LT2 v2.24** (compact Blood Red animated UI). The launcher is the entry point and loads that exact module from an immutable GitHub commit when you select **Lumber Tycoon 2**.

## Run Mystics

Execute this launcher command:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MysticsALT/temp/main/Mystics_Launcher.lua"))()
```

Then select **Lumber Tycoon 2** in the Mystics Hub. The launcher downloads and runs the pinned LT2 v2.24 module. It includes the Wire Art Studio, with a built-in Mystics cursive sign preset, editable dimensions, an in-world neon preview, preview repositioning, and a separate confirm-to-place step. Wire Art Studio includes a built-in Mystics cursive sign preset, editable dimensions, an in-world neon preview, preview repositioning, and a separate confirm-to-place step. v2.24 is rebuilt from the stable v2.21 module and adds a safe Wire Placement Diagnostics panel. SCAN WIRE SETUP only inspects the ClientPlacedWire remote, Wire template and owned Wire models; it does not send placement requests. The Wire Art Studio and Wire Placement Diagnostics now have their own WIRE ART tab, separate from TOOLS. v2.24 adds local design editing controls: horizontal mirror, vertical flip, undo, redo, and JSON export (copy-to-clipboard when the executor exposes setclipboard). These edits do not place anything in-game. v2.24 replaces bulk placement with a single-wire diagnostic smoke test after v2.26 caused a client crash. TEST ONE WIRE sends at most one short segment using the public five-argument LT2 spawn_wire signature and checks for a newly replicated owned Wire model. CONFIRM & PLACE PREVIEW is intentionally paused until the one-wire test is confirmed stable. The user must own at least one purchased Wire item. The tab includes the Mystics cursive preset, custom JSON path input, adjustable dimensions, local neon preview, clear/update controls, validation, existing placement controls, and a read-only scan of the LT2 wire remote, Purchasables/WireObjects/Wire.OtherInfo metadata path, discovered WireObjects children, and owned Wire models. Custom JSON stroke paths are also supported. Stand facing the wall where you want the art, and make sure enough Wire items are available in your inventory. It does not run an older embedded copy.

# Mystics Hub

The current Lumber Tycoon 2 module is **Mystics LT2 v2.18** (compact Blood Red animated UI). The launcher is the entry point and loads that exact module from an immutable GitHub commit when you select **Lumber Tycoon 2**.

## Run Mystics

Execute this launcher command:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MysticsALT/temp/main/Mystics_Launcher.lua"))()
```

Then select **Lumber Tycoon 2** in the Mystics Hub. The launcher downloads and runs the pinned LT2 v2.18 module. It includes the Wire Art Studio, where you can paste JSON stroke paths converted from an image, validate the paths, and submit them as wire placements. Stand facing the wall where you want the art, and make sure enough Wire items are available in your inventory. It does not run an older embedded copy.

- The launcher checks for the `V2.18 | Self-contained` module marker before executing.
